title: About me
---

Iâ€™m a lead econometrician at [Ingress Health](https://www.ingress-health.com/), working on statistical models applied in health economics and real world evidence. I have a master in Econometrics from the [Erasmus university](https://www.eur.nl/en/) in Rotterdam, where I focussed on Operations Research and Quantitative Logistics.

After spending a couple years in Asia to work on some challenging problems in the energy sector, I relocated back to the Netherlands in 2019. Here I started working at [Ingress Health](https://www.ingress-health.com/), combining my interest in econometrics with medicine (which I briefly studied in Groningen).

My main focus is on advanced analytical methods applied in health economics, varying from Bayesian survival extrapolation to utility analyses.
